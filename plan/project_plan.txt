Big Question: 
Find the most similar sequence in dog_breeds.fa to the sequence given in mystery.fa 

most basic: 
> function 1: isolate the sequences using the biopython seq method maybe, or by splitting the sequences  
> function 2: calculate the sequence identity to the mystery.fa 
> function 3: return the percentage difference between the two structures and return the most similar sequence 
    - Maybe generate a sequence alignment? 

stretch goal:
> The probability that the mystery sequence is that of each given breed (p-value)
> Create a reconstructed phylogeny - using matplotlib?
