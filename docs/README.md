Project Title: DNA identification project for different dog breeds 

Project Description
==
This is a program which compares an input sequence to a database containing sequences of different dog breeds. The program identifies which sequence in the database is most similar to the input sequence and outputs the most simlar sequence along with the % difference between the two sequences. 

Stretch: The program will also output the probability of the input sequence belonging to each dog breed and will return a phylogenic tree relating to the input sequence.
